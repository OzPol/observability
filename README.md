# Observability
Node.js backend observability project using OpenTelemetry and Jaeger for tracing, metrics, and logs.


# Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of observability in a Node.js application using **OpenTelemetry** and **Jaeger**. It focuses on backend tracing, collecting telemetry data (traces, logs, and metrics), and exporting it to a tracing backend for monitoring and visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express**: API framework.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing application data.
- **OpenTelemetry**: Observability framework.
- **Jaeger**: Tracing and monitoring backend.

## Objective
- Implement observability in a Node.js backend application.
- Configure OpenTelemetry with Jaeger for tracing.
- Analyze telemetry data to gain insights into system performance and diagnose issues.
